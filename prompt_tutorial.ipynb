Let's solve the equation step-by-step.\\n\\nThe equation we have is:\\n\\\\[ 2x + 5 = 15 \\\\]\\n\\n**Step 1: Isolate the term with \\\\(x\\\\)**  \\nWe want to get \\\\(2x\\\\) by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract \\\\(5\\\\) from both sides. \\n\\nSo, we do:\\n\\\\[ 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5 \\\\]\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\\\[ 2x = 10 \\\\]\\n\\n**Step 2: Solve for \\\\(x\\\\)**  \\nNow we need to get \\\\(x\\\\) by itself.
